**- An overview of your dataset**

**What does it include?**

Our data set includes NBA players and their salaries, the team they play for, their ranking, and more statistics regarding the individual players.


**Where and how will you be obtaining it? Include the link and source.**

We will be obtaining data from kaggle and Basketball Reference.

**About how many observations? How many predictors?**
Observations are  statistics of each NBA player, such as points per game. The predictor will be their salary in the next year.

**What types of variables will you be working with?**
Most of our variables will be numerical. Character and logical variables will also exist.

**Is there any missing data? About how much? Do you have an idea for how to handle it?**

In the basketball reference data, some salaries for the 2021-2022 season are missing. This could be because of injury or other external factors. We will handle this by disregarding the data.

**- An overview of your research question(s)**

**What variable(s) are you interested in predicting? What question(s) are you interested in answering?**

We want to know variables such as MPG, PPG, RPG, APG, SPG, BPG, PER, Age, (basketball statistics), etc. Given these variables, how much will a player earn?

**Name your response/outcome variable(s) and briefly describe it/them.**

The response variable is the salary we want to predict of nba players. How much salary will a player earn for a future season? 

**Will these questions be best answered with a classification or regression approach?**

Regression approach will be the best because it deals with numbers and multiple predictors. 

**Which predictors do you think will be especially useful?**

The most useful predictor is probably the rank of the player because it determines how valuable they are to the team.

**- Your proposed project timeline and group work**

**How is your group dividing up the work?**

We will all work together on the code and we will be meeting via zoom, or in person in the case that school continues in person to discuss tasks that need to be completed, and who is responsible for each task.

**When do you plan on having your data set loaded, beginning your exploratory data analysis, etc?**

We plan on having our data set loaded and beginning our exploratory data analysis 1/24/21.

**Any questions or concerns**

Can we have more than one dataset? And if we do, how will that affect our project?

**Are there any problems or difficult aspects of the project you anticipate?**

Some players are currently signed to contracts so their salaries for the next couple of years are already confirmed. Maybe we can use this to check the variability of our machine learning algorithm. 
Salary could also be affected by inflation or lockouts, so errors may be common.

**Any specific questions you have for me/the instructional team?**

What is the maximum number of datasets we can use, and how would that affect our project.
